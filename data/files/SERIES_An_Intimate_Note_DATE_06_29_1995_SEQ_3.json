If some other ingredient is too much, it can all be adjusted and repaired. But once it is cooked, it cannot be reversed.\n\nMilk can become sweet yogurt or sour yogurt, and sour yogurt can be sweetened. But neither can be reversed back to milk.\n\nSanchita Karma can be changed and adjusted by spiritual practices. Prarabdha Karma cannot be changed. And Satsang burns the seed of all negative Karma before they are given a chance to sprout.",
