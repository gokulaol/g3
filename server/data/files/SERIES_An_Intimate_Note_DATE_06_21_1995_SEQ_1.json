Every event colors your awareness in some way: pleasure, pain, joy, sorrow, anger, jealousy. Each event gives you a false notion of what reality is. Truth is beyond all the colors of particular events. \n\nBehind every object is infinity. Objects are limited and changing, yet they exist in infinite space that never changes. Reduce any object to atoms; you will find that within each atom is contained infinite space. Beyond all objects is infinity.\n\nBeyond each person is love. A personality changes. A body, a mind, a complex of behaviors is always changing. Beyond each personality there is unchanging love. love is what you are. When you lose your self, you'll find your Self!  \n\nThe event behind the event is Knowledge. The object behind the object is infinity. The person behind person is Love. \n\nMaya - delusion - is when you are stuck in events, personalities, or objects. Brahman - divine consciousness - is seeing beyond all these.\n\nSee? Just a little shift.\n",
